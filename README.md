## Motivation
> This is Shopify's Front End Developer Intern Challenge - Winter 2022, even though the requirment was for front-end only, I wanted to make a deployed full-stack application because I really enjoy working with data and backend system designs. I also wanted to challenge myself further by using a language(Typescript) that I was unfamiliar with and also with a concept(React Hooks) that I did not really touch until now. I opted for a more minimalistic design because the contrast between the darkness in space and the white plain background really highlights the pictures. One of my main motivation is that I was really glad that the API is astronomy related because I have always had a fascination with outer space and one of my life goals is to live in space and to observe Earth and if I am lucky enough, I would be writing software whilst in space.
